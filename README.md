# Bellman-Ford Algorithm Demo

## Explanation

this [article](https://brilliant.org/wiki/bellman-ford-algorithm/) does it best !

### high level idea:
- shortest path finding in a mixed-weighted graph (negative & positive edges)
- negative cycles detection
- time complexity: O(V * E) where E: n of Edges and V: n of vertices
- space complexity: O(V)
- it's slower than Dijkstra, but the latter fails at negative edges. Therefore more versatile.
